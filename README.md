# Backgammon

Project made for the course APR2 in the bachelor's degree study programme Applied informatics at [UJEP](https://ujep.cz).

## Summary

The project is the implementation of the boardgame Backgammon done solely in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Colorama [link](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

## Installation
